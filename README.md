A repository for markable work on 52167 Programming and Scripting

## Week 2
- Task: Write a program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI). Call the file bmi.py. The inputs are the person's height in centimetres and weight in kilograms.
The output their BMI (You may need to look up how this is calculated);
- File submitted: [BMI](/bmi.py);
- Solution source was the [NHS BMI calculator](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/bmi-calculator/).
- Working notes: I amended the tool to include the {:.2f} information at line 7 to restrict decimal places after reviewing the lecture material in week 4. I have also used integers over floats, as I don't anticipate most people knowing their height and weight to a gram or millimetre granularity.

## Week 3
- Task: Write a program that asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order;
- File submitted: [secondstring](/secondstring.py);
- Solution sources were [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_howto_reverse_string.asp) and ultimately [W3Schools' Slice Function](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_slice.asp) page;
Working notes: I couldn't get the [::-1] syntax that W3 was giving me to work without also defining a function, so I've determined the start point of the function by calculating the length of the string as inputLen and setting the end point as zero. I also initially set this as 1 but it then skipped the final character.
